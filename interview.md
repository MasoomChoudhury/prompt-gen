## Potential Interview Questions

### Project Overview Questions

1. **What inspired you to create PromptGen?**
   - *Answer*: I was experimenting with various AI models and noticed that the quality of prompts significantly affected the results. I wanted to create a tool that could help me and others craft better prompts without needing to become prompt engineering experts.

2. **How does PromptGen improve upon manual prompt writing?**
   - *Answer*: PromptGen uses a specialized system prompt that incorporates best practices for prompt engineering. It structures prompts with clear instructions, examples, and output format specifications, which typically lead to more consistent and higher-quality AI responses.

3. **What was the biggest challenge you faced during development?**
   - *Answer*: Integrating with the Gemini API and handling its response format was challenging initially. Also, designing an effective system prompt that could enhance a wide variety of user inputs required several iterations and testing.

### Technical Questions

4. **Why did you choose React and TypeScript for this project?**
   - *Answer*: React provides a component-based architecture that made it easy to organize the UI elements. TypeScript added type safety, which helped prevent bugs and improved code quality, especially when working with API responses and state management.

5. **Explain your approach to styling in this project.**
   - *Answer*: I used Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling combined with shadcn/ui components for consistent UI elements. I created a custom design system with HSL color variables and gradient definitions in the CSS, which allowed for a cohesive visual identity while maintaining flexibility.

6. **How did you handle API key security in the application?**
   - *Answer*: The application requires users to input their own API key, which is stored only in component state and never persisted. This approach avoids exposing my own API key and gives users control over their usage. In a production environment with a backend, I would implement server-side API calls to avoid exposing keys in the frontend.

7. **What improvements would you make to the current error handling?**
   - *Answer*: I would implement more specific error messages based on different API error codes, add retry logic for transient failures, and potentially add logging for better debugging. I would also consider adding validation for the API key format before attempting requests.

### Architecture Questions

8. **Why did you choose to use React Query in this project?**
   - *Answer*: While this project doesn't heavily utilize React Query's caching capabilities, I included it as part of the architecture to allow for future expansion. If the app were to grow to include features like saved prompts or user accounts, React Query would provide efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization.

9. **How would you scale this application for more features?**
   - *Answer*: I would implement a more robust state management solution like Redux or Context API, add a backend service for user authentication and prompt storage, and potentially create a more modular component structure. I'd also consider implementing a design system library to maintain consistency as the UI grows.

10. **Explain your folder structure and organization principles.**
    - *Answer*: I organized the code with a component-based approach, separating UI components from page components. The main application logic is contained in the PromptGenerator component, while routing and providers are set up in App.tsx. This structure follows the principle of separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable.

### Performance Questions

11. **What performance optimizations have you implemented?**
    - *Answer*: I've kept component re-renders minimal by using state effectively, implemented loading states to provide user feedback during API calls, and used Vite as a build tool for faster development and optimized production builds. The application also uses lazy loading for routes to reduce the initial bundle size.

12. **How would you improve the application's loading performance?**
    - *Answer*: I would implement code splitting for larger components, optimize image assets, add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance, and potentially implement a service worker for caching static assets. I would also consider using the Suspense API for data fetching when it becomes more stable.

### User Experience Questions

13. **How did you approach the UI/UX design for this application?**
    - *Answer*: I focused on creating a clean, intuitive interface with clear visual hierarchy. The gradient backgrounds add visual interest without distracting from the content. I implemented suggestion cards to help users get started quickly and added toast notifications for clear feedback on actions.

14. **What accessibility considerations did you incorporate?**
    - *Answer*: I used shadcn/ui components which have accessibility built-in, including keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and focus management. I ensured sufficient color contrast and included proper labeling for form elements. However, there's room for improvement with more comprehensive keyboard navigation and screen reader testing.

### Future Development Questions

15. **What features would you add in the next version?**
    - *Answer*: I would add user authentication to save favorite prompts, implement more specialized prompt templates for different domains, add the ability to share prompts, and potentially integrate with more AI models beyond Gemini.

16. **How would you implement user authentication in this application?**
    - *Answer*: I would use a service like Firebase Authentication or Auth0 for the authentication layer, create protected routes using React Router, implement a user context for managing auth state, and add a backend service for storing user-specific data securely.

17. **What testing strategies would you implement for this project?**
    - *Answer*: I would add unit tests for utility functions using Jest, component tests with React Testing Library, integration tests for API interactions with MSW (Mock Service Worker), and end-to-end tests with Cypress to ensure the full user flow works correctly.

### Deployment and DevOps Questions

18. **Explain the Vercel deployment configuration you implemented.**
    - *Answer*: I created a vercel.json file to specify build commands and output directories, modified the package.json build scripts to explicitly reference the Vite executable path to avoid module resolution issues, and added a .vercelignore file to exclude unnecessary files from deployment.

19. **What CI/CD practices would you recommend for this project?**
    - *Answer*: I would implement automated testing on pull requests, linting and type checking in the CI pipeline, automated deployments to staging environments for feature branches, and production deployments only after manual approval. I would also add monitoring and error tracking with a service like Sentry.

20. **How would you handle environment variables and configuration for different deployment environments?**
    - *Answer*: I would use .env files for local development, Vercel's environment variable system for deployment environments, and implement a configuration service that loads the appropriate values based on the current environment. Sensitive values would never be committed to the repository.
