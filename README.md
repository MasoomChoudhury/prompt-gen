# 🚀 PromptGen - My AI Prompt Generator Project

## 🙏 Namaste Everyone!

I am Masoom Choudhury, a passionate Computer Science student from India with a keen interest in AI and web development. This project is born out of my curiosity to explore the capabilities of Gemini API and create something useful for my portfolio while applying for internships.

## 💡 What is PromptGen?

PromptGen is a tool I developed to generate enhanced AI prompts using the Gemini API. During my learning journey, I realized how important well-crafted prompts are for getting the best results from AI models. So I thought, "Why not create a tool that helps with this?" and here we are!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I Learned

For this project, I challenged myself to learn and implement:

- **React** - For building the UI components
- **TypeScript** - My first serious project using TS instead of plain JavaScript!
- **Vite** - Super fast build tool that I recently discovered
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling without writing tons of CSS
- **shadcn-ui** - Beautiful UI components that saved me lots of time

## ✨ Features

- Generate enhanced AI prompts using Gemini API
- Copy generated prompts to clipboard with one click
- Predefined prompt templates for common use cases
- Responsive design that works on mobile too!

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

If you want to check out my work, it's very simple to run:

```sh
# Step 1: Navigate to the project directory.
cd PromptGen

# Step 2: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 3: Start the development server with auto-reloading.
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Deployment

I have deployed this project on Vercel for free. You can also deploy it on Netlify or any other static hosting service.

## 🔮 Future Scope

I plan to add more features like:
- User authentication
- Saving favorite prompts
- More templates for different use cases
- Integration with other AI models
